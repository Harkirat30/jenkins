param.  - means using interpolation
env.(variable)  - getting the environament variable

credentails()- It is a method to extract credentials from Jenkins- It binds the credetials to your env variable
server_credetials = credentails('ID') , it takes ID referance of the credentails in jenkins
Need to have credentaials Binding plugin
IF we are going to use the credentails in a specific state - it's better to define them inside
a wrapper - withCredentails()
withCredentails() - is a wrapper that takes as a parameter and object, 
object is usernamePassword() - this is basically a function that help us get the username and password individually 
usernamePassword(credentails : 'ID', 
The reason we used usernamePassword is because the type of credentails we created is username and pass

Credentails and Credentails Binding plugin should be used
Credentails plugin allows to create credentails in Jenkins UI
and Binding plugin allows to use credentails in env variables in jenkinsfile

We can add Jenkins credentails as System or Global scope,
System credentails - means only available on Jenkins server , not for Jenkins job
Global - accessible everywhere

3rd scope comes only with multi-branch pipeline
Comes from folder plugin
